# Bot Activista [ICDemocracia17 Presentation]
In November 2017 I was one of the 70 people chosen to collaborate with Collective Intelligence for Democracy, a prototyping workshop/experience organized by Medialab Prado in Madrid/ES. This repository holds the final keynote of our project, Bot Activista, presented at the international conference Democratic Cities, held in Teatro Español, Madrid/ES, on November 2017.
